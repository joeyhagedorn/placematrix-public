### PlaceMatrix

Many thanks to this tutorial for helping me deploy my first Elastic Beanstalk app on AWS:

Place Matrix is documented at https://www.joeyhagedorn.com

This project is an attempt to bring Reddit's "Place" to the real world by interfacing with The Matrix from Boldport. It consists of both a physical segment, the LED matrix display, a microcontroller that connects this to the internet, as well as a web application to allow anyone that is logged in from the internet to toggle these LEDs. Results are reflected through a YouTube stream.

All of the necessary security keys, tokens, passwords, etc have been replaced with REDACTED in the source. You'll need to replace them to get this app running.
